# Intake-Continuation-Insights-for-HIV-Prevention-Pills-in-Kenya
HIV preventive pills have been freely available to all Kenyans at multiple clinics across the country. However, despite this availability, the initial uptake and continued use of these pills has decreased over time. This analysis investigated trends in the use and continuation of the HIV pills to confirm whether the low continuation rates are a result of behavioral issues. 
Common patterns leading to discontinued use were identified and appropriate intervention plans have been provided in the report.
